# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I'm currently a BSc student in Chemistry although lately in my spare time i often find myself trying to learn about programming and creating something with it. I'm curious about the low level aspects of how things work, that's why i focused on OpenGL, C and C++ so far and tried to create as much as possible from scratch. I consider myself a person capable of adapting to various contexts since i've done different types of jobs in the past, and very eager to learn, i always try to make time in the day to expand my knowlege about a topic. I like enjoying my free time practicing and watching sports or going on an hike. My main choices when it comes to entertainment are podcasts and stand-up comedy.
